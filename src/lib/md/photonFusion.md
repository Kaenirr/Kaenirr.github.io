[`Photon Fusion`](https://www.photonengine.com/fusion) is the high-end state transfer netcode SDK made for Unity Professionals. Fusion supports different network topologies and replication algorithms while exposing a single consistent API. This allows developers to focus on what really matters most: writing their own game.
